My notes written with cherrytree.

This includes lessons I learned while studying for the OSCP certification, but also includes my own research that wasn't covered by Offsec & won't be relevant to the exam.

This will *eventually* be an organized compilation of various online resources & thousands of pages of my notes.

These notes currently contain links to files which won't work for you, & references to page numbers in my notebooks which also won't help you.
